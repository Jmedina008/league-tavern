## üéØ Smart Features

### **Manager Profiling System**
```javascript
const managerProfiles = {
  "TradeMaster_Mike": {
    tendencies: {
      aggression: 8.5, // 1-10 scale
      waiver_activity: 9.2,
      start_sit_accuracy: 6.8,
      trade_frequency: "high"
    },
    patterns: {
      "performs_better_as_underdog": 0.73, // 73% correlation
      "clutch_performer": 0.82, // Performs better in must-win
      "boom_bust_tolerance": "high"
    },
    historical_matchups: {
      vs_TeamThunder: { wins: 3, losses: 1, avg_margin: 12.4 }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Storyline Intelligence**
```javascript
const narrativeEngine = {
  detectStorylines: (matchup, history) => {
    // Revenge game narrative
    if (lastMeetingWasBlowout(history)) {
      return "revenge_game"
    }
    
    // Rivalry escalation
    if (closeHistoricalGames(history) && trash_talk_detected) {
      return "heated_rivalry"
    }
    
    // Cinderella story
    if (underdog_on_hot_streak && favorite_slumping) {
      return "momentum_shift"
    }
  },
  
  generateNarrative: (storyline, context) => {
    // Dynamic story generation based on actual league context
  }
}
```

### **Predictive Accuracy Tracking**
```javascript
const accuracyTracker = {
  prediction_types: {
    spread_predictions: {
      correct: 67, // out of 100 predictions
      within_3pts: 83,
      big_misses: 12
    },
    total_predictions: {
      over_under_record: "56-44",
      average_error: 8.2
    }
  },
  
  // Adjust confidence based on accuracy
  getConfidenceLevel: (prediction_type, matchup_factors) => {
    return calculation_based_on_historical_accuracy
  }
}
```

## üî• Example Advanced Preview

### **Week 8: Thunder Bolts vs Lightning Strikes**

**üìà Intelligence Summary**
- **Historical**: Thunder Bolts lead series 4-2, but Lightning won last meeting by 28
- **Recent Form**: Thunder (3-1 last 4), Lightning (1-3, but close losses)
- **Momentum**: Lightning on 2-game "bad beat" streak (lost by <5 both times)
- **Prediction Confidence**: 78% (above average due to clear trend data)

**üéØ Key Analytics**
- **Projected Score**: Thunder 118.3 ¬± 12.1, Lightning 108.7 ¬± 9.4
- **Spread**: Thunder -9.5 (73% confidence)
- **X-Factor**: Lightning's RB situation (handcuff lottery this week)

**üìä Deep Dive Analysis**
Thunder owner Mike has historically struggled in "bounce-back" spots (2-7 ATS as favorite after loss), while Lightning's Sarah excels as large underdog (8-3 SU when getting >7 points). This creates a fascinating dynamic where the "wrong" team might be favored.

**üîÆ Scenario Modeling**
- If Lightning's waiver RB hits (40% chance): Projected gap narrows to 4.5 points
- If Thunder's star WR sits (injury report): Line flips to Lightning -2
- Weather factor: Indoor game negates outdoor concerns

**üìù Narrative Thread**
This continues the "Sarah's Revenge Tour" storyline after last week's crushing loss. Mike's tendency to overthink lineups as favorite plays into Sarah's "set and forget" advantage. The subplot of Mike's trade deadline aggression vs Sarah's steady-hands approach adds intrigue.
